/// Represents an L2CAP (Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol) channel 
/// for communication with a Bluetooth device.
///
/// L2CAP is a protocol in the Bluetooth protocol stack that handles multiplexing, 
/// segmentation and reassembly, and error detection and recovery for higher level protocols.
/// It provides connection-oriented and connectionless data services to upper layer protocols.
///
/// This class provides methods to read, write, and manage L2CAP channel communication.
///
/// Example usage:
/// ```dart
/// // Open an L2CAP channel
/// BluetoothL2capChannel channel = await device.openL2CapChannel(1234);
/// 
/// // Write data to the channel
/// await channel.write([0x01, 0x02, 0x03]);
/// 
/// // Read data from the channel
/// List<int> data = await channel.read();
/// 
/// // Close the channel when done
/// await channel.close();
/// ```

  /// PSM values are used to distinguish between different services/protocols
  /// running over L2CAP on the same device.
  final int psm;

  /// Creates a new [BluetoothL2capChannel] instance.
  ///
  /// [deviceId] - The identifier of the Bluetooth device
  /// [psm] - The Protocol Service Multiplexer value for this channel
  BluetoothL2capChannel({required this.deviceId, required this.psm});

  /// Writes data to the L2CAP channel.
  ///
  /// Sends the provided [data] bytes to the remote device over this L2CAP channel.
  /// The data is transmitted as-is without any additional framing or headers.
  ///
  /// [data] - The bytes to send. Can be any list of integers (0-255).
  ///
  /// Throws [FlutterBluePlusException] if the write operation fails or 
  /// the channel is not open.
  ///
  /// Example:
  /// ```dart
  /// await channel.write([0x48, 0x65, 0x6C, 0x6C, 0x6F]); // "Hello" in ASCII
